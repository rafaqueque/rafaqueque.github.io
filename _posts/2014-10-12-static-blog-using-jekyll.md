I wanted to try a new approach when it comes to blogging. In the past, I was
using [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and it was very easy to use and all that
jazz.

But I wanted something new, something more "hacky". Always loved how many
developers had their own blogs and personal websites based in Jekyll. Isn't it
lovely to create a new post using `vim` and then `git push` to publish it to
[Github Pages](http://github.com)?

Even if Github disappears, I still have the content on my local machine and I
can easily push it to my server.

Main benefits? Speed, absolutely. Since it's a static website, there's no
database, it's pure text, since most of the time I don't images at all. Still
needs some adjustment, but so far, I'm loving this. No hassle, no stupid
configurations and there's plenty of tutorials out there to get a Jekyll-based
blog running on top of Github.

It's convenient for me to have it on Github, but I'm truly thinking about
switching to my server and get it up and running along
[rafael.pt](http://rafael.pt), which is a static website as well.
