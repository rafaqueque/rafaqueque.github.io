I applied for an invite for the new Inbox and I was quite excited when I
received that invite. Since I'm paying for my Google Apps account, to have my
own domain attached to their services, I was expected some sort of early
access. That means "I'm expecting to test Inbox, at least, at the same time as
free users are doing right now", but nope, no go.

So, I support their services by paying a small fee per month, but I have no
early access to new released stuff? Nice way to treat customers.

Also, on my previous (free) Gmail account, I had some extensions published on
Chrome Webstore, but when I created the Google Apps account, I transfered the
ownership for this user instead. In the past, I didn't pay a dime for anything
I published there, but when updating Gmail Checker Lite yesterday, they asked
for a $5 developer fee. What the hell, Google?

So, someone creates a free and spammy account, publishes some malicious
extension and pay nothing for that, is that really simple and "secure"?

Instead, I actually have my verified domain, proper paid Gmail account and I
still need to pay an additional fee to publish stuff there.

I don't understand you, Google. Sort it out, ffs.
