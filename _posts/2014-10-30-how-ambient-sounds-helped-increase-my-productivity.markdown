I've been searching and trying around different music styles in order to
increase my productivity, but I guess I found the right path. Have you ever
tried to listen to rain, thunderstorms and feel like you're in a different
world? Totally abstracted from everything and focused?

If not, please do it.

### Ok, but where do I find that?
It's not that difficult. You can search [Youtube](http://youtube.com) for "rain
sounds" or "ambient sounds". It's easy enough to get stuck in a 10 hours loop
mixing rain, thunderstorms, heavy wind and probably some random noises that
will scare you from now and then.

If you use [Spotify](http://spotify.com), there's also some playlists available
built by the team, totally dedicated to this cause. Give it a try with [this
one](http://open.spotify.com/user/spotifybrazilian/playlist/1F9Nnd5leX5WGJid5SKgCg).

A good website that also does a great job, is [Noisli](http://noisli.com).
Either you set your own flavour or you can use their presets for productivity.
Bonus: they have a zen-like text editor that smoothly changes your background
while you're listening and drafting something cool.

### How did this improve your productivity? 
Well, if you're a programmer like me, you probably like to be in your own
world, minding your own business and hoping that no one will ever interrupt
your focused and precious time.

I can really focus on solving exciting problems. Hours will pass by and you'll
have your work done, for sure. I noticed one day that I planned a few tasks for
the whole day and I manage to take care of that in about 2 hours. Is this a
good example for you?

Give it a try; doesn't harm and it's always cool to experience new stuff.
