I'm a monospace font lover because I'm a programmer. Since I have to deal with
monospaced fonts the entire day, I have to choose a really nice font, which I
can distinguish the O from 0, 1 from l and so on.

For programming, I'm sticking with `Source Code Pro` at the moment and it's
been great. Lovely font, very readable, comes in several flavours, ranging from
`ExtraLight` to `Black` (even bolder than `Bold`). The Retina display on my
Macs allow me to choose the `Light` version. Tiny, crispy and minimalistic. I
could go for the `ExtraLight`, but it's too much already.

The same applies for my websites. This blog, as you can see, it's updated with
a new font. In this case, since it's quite hard for everyone to have `Source
Code Pro` installed by default, I went with `Menlo`.

My personal website was updated as well. Check it [here](http://rafael.pt).
