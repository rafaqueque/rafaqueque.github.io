Finally, I will attend [Django: Under The Hood](http://www.djangounderthehood.com/), my first international development conference ever. I’m very excited about this and there are some really nice talks that I want to attend.

Specially, the “Internationalisation” talk, by Jannis Leidel, since we have to deal with 4 languages in our application every single day and sometimes we struggle to make it work seamlessly.

Also, never been to Amsterdam before and seems like a nice city to visit, not only once, but twice, and the next time will be with my better half, for sure.

PS: Another business travel. I’m getting used to this kind of short business trips, so please, don’t stop.
