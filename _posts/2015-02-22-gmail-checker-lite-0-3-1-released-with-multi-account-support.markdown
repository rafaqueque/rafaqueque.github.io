Very happy to announce Gmail Checker Lite 0.3.1 with multiple accounts support.

If you're logged-in with two accounts at the same time, you might have noticed
the icon swapping colors between bright red and bright blue. Red, is now the
counter for the primary Gmail account, and the blue badge takes care of the
second logged-in account.

The reason behind this method for displaying counters for different accounts is
to avoid popups because an extension like this must be simple and easy to use.
No more elements should be added to the UI, nor new clicks just to open a Gmail
tab.

As usual, you can check the latest information
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-checker-lite-multi/ehecgbjlfigjeeapplnmliblgpkjaeme).
It should auto-update, anyway. If you want to contribute to the development,
suggest new features or just give some feedback, you can head to the main
repository at
[rafaqueque/gmail-checker-lite](https://github.com/rafaqueque/gmail-checker-lite/).

Latest analytics shows that the extension passed 1200 installs already and I'm
hoping to increase this number with the latest feature announced.
