And it's already packed. In less than 48 hours, all the spots were taken and,
sadly, there's no more space available. Although the website says registrations
are still open, I have the information that they're not. You still have a
chance if someone quits.

Back to the business.

DATES, DATES, DATES. The event will be on March 21st, in Startup Lisboa's
offices at Rua da Prata, 80, from 10am to 6pm.

Sherpany is providing a one-day workshop for beginners, doesn't matter if
you're male or female, because we care about people, not genders. Also, you
don't have to pay anything; food and beverages are on us.

You just need to bring your own laptop and lots of patience â€“ I'm part of the
coaching team and we will take good care of you. This is for beginners, so we
don't expect that you know everything and we will try to teach you everything
bit by bit.

For more information, head to the [official
website](http://djangogirls.org/lisbon/). If you have any technical issues that
need to be addressed before the workshop, [get in touch with me on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/rafaqueque).

PS: Don't let us touch the keyboard!
