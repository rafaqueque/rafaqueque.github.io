I'm not a fanboy. I was a heavy Windows user for the last 10 years. I use Linux
every day due to my job as a developer. I only own Macs at the moment, so I'm a
power user of OS X as well. Once a guy said: "Use the tools for the job" and that is my motto, and it works like a charm.

When it comes to smartphones, it's not that different. I had several Symbian
"smartphones", then switched to low-end Android and now I own a quad-core, all
pumped up for the price (120$, Alcatel Pop C7). Being a quad-core, I tought
that was the killer feature, I was only thinking about speed, performance in
general, but nop, didn't work. It's still slow, laggy and the user experience
on this is quite awful. The only Android smartphones that work as expected are
the one released by Google (Nexus line) or some high-end $600 piece of
hardware.

I like the concept behind Android. Being open source is really great because
the community can really contribute for the development, but then you have
manufacturers fucking the system by throwing in bloatware, stupid user
interfaces and shit like that. That really pisses me off. There's no need to
degrade the user experience just because you want to be different.

Enough with Android. I bought an iPhone. Found a really good deal, for a brand
new (really new, in store) iPhone 5C 32GB white version. Paid 350$ for it. I
know it's not the newest iPhone 6, all pumped up with processing power and so
on, but here in Portugal we can't afford and we don't have 2 year contracts
available that put your iPhone in the low $100's.

First thing I notice is the speed. Garbage collection for Android sucks,
because it's Java and it's made to work with a LOT of different hardware
configurations. 

Apple got it right, just like OS X. Works as it should, really
fast and can last you a few years without any problem. My previous Macbook was
a late-2010 model and it worked really fine until I got my new Retina mid-2014.

I really like the integration with OS X, specially with the new Yosemite. I'll
stick with this configuration for the next years. I needed a change.
