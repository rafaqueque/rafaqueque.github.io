I went to Zürich last week and it’s been great.

Finally met the rest of the team and had a very productive time. Also, had the chance to celebrate my first year at Sherpany. It’s been a great year, full of surprises, both personally and professionally. Learned a lot with all of them and I want that to continue for many years.

It was my first time doing business travels (for real) and I must say that I’m already loving it. Well, only if there’s a purpose, although I really like to travel and airplanes in general.

Oh, and my [Flight Diary](http://flightdiary.com) account likes this as well.
