So, I'm leaving [Sherpany](http://sherpany.com).

I've been one of the first engineers when they opened their IT department
in Lisbon and I'm 100% proud of what I've done and the decisions I've been
part of during the last 2 years and a half.

The biggest decision I've ever made in my life, but I'm in the age
of taking risks, aiming high and try some moonshots.

I feel it's the right time to move on. I need new challenges and the
problems I'm facing, more on the personal side, are standing in the way.
Need some fresh stuff, a new job, new technology, new programming language
or just new people in my life.

Not trying to say it's bad or was bad in the past, but I need something
different.  I've been losing my passion for programming in the last months
and I want that back; I've been doing this for more than 10 years already and it's
the first time I feel like shit.

This year was, by far, the worst year in my life (again, more on the
personal side), and starting something new, focused and feeling
challenged, is the cure for this, I think â€“ that's why I want to take this
risk.

You will now find me at [Talkdesk](https://talkdesk.com).
