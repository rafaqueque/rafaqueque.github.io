Recruiters nowadays are going too far with the process. If you are a market
research god, head hunter, top notch recruiter, you'll probably know that 95%
of us don't like companies like yours.

### Accepting connections on LinkedIn
By accepting your connection request on LinkedIn, doesn't mean you can bug
me with offers all the time. Some of them, I'll read, but since I don't use
LinkedIn at all, I'll probably skip them and "mark as read" will be favorite
tool for this.

### One e-mail is fine
I now accepted your connection on LinkedIn, but you still insist on sending me
e-mails with offers, although I haven't answered in the past.  That's ok, you
are really interested and you want to contact me about more offers. But
remember, don't send the same e-mail twice. If I don't answer to your requests,
the next ones will be ignored automatically. Be reasonable and just stop.

### Phone calls twice a day? Too much already
Ok, you're being an asshole already. Don't call me twice a day. I guess it's
already obvious that I don't really care. My free time is to be spent with my
family and friends, without having work-related stuff in my head and bugging me
all the time.

If you have consideration for yourself and you don't like this kind of stuff,
be reasonable, again, and stop.

### Leaving text messages? Stop it, fucker
Man, if I don't reply to your LinkedIn messages, e-mails, phone calls and other
stuff, why do you still insist and leave text messages?

### #protip
Try a single approach like "I would love to stop by, buy you a coffee and talk
about this exciting project". It's enough and I'll gladly join you. But one of
my questions to you will be: "Why would I want to work for you if I'm getting
shit paid and be treated like a resource and not a human?

I'm not the best guy to give advice to recruiters. Just my 2 cents.
