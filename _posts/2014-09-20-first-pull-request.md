I’m an open source addict since the beginning. I love the concept, I love the people who push for it and, obviously, the projects. Therefore, my first pull request, in the not-so-sweat summer of 2014.

You can check it [here](http://firstpr.me/#rafaqueque), with a small tool (actually, a website) I found on Twitter. It was not rocket science, but we we’re struggling when building our project at [Sherpany](https://sherpany.com) and we had to find a way to get this to work properly.

After hacking the project locally and finally making it work, I had to make a decision. Either we fork this and we keep it on our side or we can contribute for the development and ship this. Let’s create a pull request, then and hope that someone approves this.

We use it all the time to build our own stuff. It’s really a requirement for us, to have this up and running properly. It’s just new option for this specific building tool. You either use it or not. Doesn’t bother and doesn’t mess your configs. So, why not?

I feel very proud. I really hope to continue forking and hacking on stuff, submitting pull requests and increase the quality of these amazing projects.

And yes, it was merged.
