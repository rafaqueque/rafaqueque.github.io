What's the point of having your RSS reader full of crap, 1000+ unread items and
so on, if you don't have the time to read them all and you just click "Mark all
as read" button? 

#### Call to action
Curate your own news and articles. You know what's good for you to read, not
the random editor guy from that fucking big website.

Get rid of it. Now. 

#### What I did instead
For me, it's enough to check local news websites, some international news
websites as well, and tech-related websites. Hacker News, Techcrunch, The Verge
and some other random website is enough for me. If it's important for me to
read, it's there.

Now, with Instapaper extension installed, I can just go to the website and hit
the button to save the article to read it later. It's a good trick if you don't
want to spend time reading the article right now and have something important
to do, like regular work, in your day job.

Also, a good addition to this is the small link appearing right next to the
comment section on Hacker News. The behaviour is pretty much the same as the
one I mentioned in the previous paragraph. 

#### When and how to read
Well, in your spare time, like commuting, before going to sleep, after dinner
and so on, you can just open your Kindle or your smartphone and you'll have a
nice list of interesting articles, curated by you, not others, to read.

This is working like a charm to me and I'm going to stick with it for the next
months. Let's see if I don't miss anything important from now on.
