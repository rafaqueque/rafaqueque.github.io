A new version was released today. Go ahead and [install
it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-checker-lite/ehecgbjlfigjeeapplnmliblgpkjaeme).

This new version brings the long awaited (probably I was the only one waiting
for this) Retina support for the icons. Also, new icons!

Those old and pixelated icons were bugging me because I don't use a Retina
display on a daily-basis and they were looking awful, screaming to be changed.

As usual, you can always contribute to the project by checking the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/rafaqueque/gmail-checker-lite/) and decide what
do you want to implement. After that, submit the pull request and I'll gladly
merge it.

PS: Close to 1000 active users. Insane.
