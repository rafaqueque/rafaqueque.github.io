The version `0.2.5` is out and it has support for the new [Google
Inbox](https://inbox.google.com). You can now choose the default app and
default behaviour for the icon when you click. Choose between Gmail or Inbox
and it's done. If you are still using Gmail (you probably are), don't
worry, you don't need to change anything.

You can go [here and install it
manually](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-checker-lite/ehecgbjlfigjeeapplnmliblgpkjaeme)
or you can just wait and it will update automatically in the next hours.

Proud to announce that I merged someone's pull request for this project for the
first time. Also proud to reach the 550+ users mark.

If you want to push new features, report bugs or just suggest something, [check
the project page and
repository](https://github.com/rafaqueque/gmail-checker-lite) on Github.

### Update
A new version `0.2.6` was relased and published already to fix a weird
behaviour with the icon click for Gmail users.
