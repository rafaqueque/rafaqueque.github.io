Yesterday, Google
[announced](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.pt/2014/10/strengthening-2-step-verification-with.html)
something very cool. You can now use your Yubikey to access your Gmail account.

### Shit, I have an unsupported version
But wait, if you're like me and you have an old version or the [standard/nano
version](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-2/) and still
want to use this, there's a solution. There's always a solution.

Have you ever thought of using a Yubikey to insert your Gmail
password and still use the 2-step verification with mobile codes or
Authenticator? Yep, it's possible.

### Changing your password settings
Download the Personalization Tools binaries [available at the official
website](http://yubikey.com/pt). This tool let you configure your Yubikey to
use static passwords instead of the default OTP (one time password). The next
step is to change your Gmail (or whatever service you want to use) password.
You can increase the security or difficulty by enabling 2-step verification and
that's what I'm using right now. I'll always need the Yubikey and my personal
cellphone number/Authenticator app available to login.

### Be smart
Keep in mind that if you loose your Yubikey, you might be
screwed, so you probably want to choose a not so random password, but still
long and memorable password to be used manually if needed.

It's not rocket science, but it will increase the difficulty when someone tries
to access your account.

Well, you can always impress your friends and co-workers.
